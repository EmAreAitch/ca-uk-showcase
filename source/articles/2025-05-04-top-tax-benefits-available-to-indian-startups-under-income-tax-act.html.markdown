  deductions under the Income Tax Act, 1961.

In recent years, the Indian startup ecosystem has witnessed tremendous growth, and the government has introduced several **tax incentives** to support this sector. As a practising Chartered Accountant, I often see startups out on valuable deductions and exemptions due to lack of awareness. Here's a quick guide to some of the key **tax benefits available to eligible startups**.

## 1. Section 80-IAC: 3-Year Tax Holiday

Recognised startups (as per DPIIT) can claim a **100% tax exemption** on profits for **any 3 consecutive years** out of the first 10 years since incorporation.

### Eligibility:

* Must be recognised by DPIIT (Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade).
* Turnover must be less than ₹100 crore in any year.
* Must be incorporated between 1st April 2016 and 31st March 2025.

## 2. Angel Tax Exemption (Section 56(2)(viib))

To encourage seed funding, the government exempts **startups from paying tax on share premium received** from resident investors—if DPIIT-recognised. Form 2 declaration must be filed with DPIIT to claim this exemption.

## 3. Capital Gains Exemption (Section 54EE / 54GB)

Startups or their investors can avail **capital gains tax exemption** by reinvesting in specified funds (Section 54EE) or into the startup’s equity (Section 54GB).

## 4. MAT Exemption for Startups (Section 115JB)

Although most companies pay **Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)** on book profits, eligible startups under 80-IAC may not be liable for MAT during the tax holiday years.

## 5. Carry Forward of Losses

Normally, a company can carry forward business losses only if there is continuity of shareholding. However, **DPIIT-recognised startups** can carry forward losses **even if shareholding changes**, provided the original shareholders continue to own the business.

## Final Thoughts

While these provisions are generous, it's essential to **plan your finances and filings proactively**. DPIIT recognition is critical to most of the benefits, and correct documentation is key. I strongly recommend working with a qualified tax advisor or CA before raising funds or claiming exemptions.
