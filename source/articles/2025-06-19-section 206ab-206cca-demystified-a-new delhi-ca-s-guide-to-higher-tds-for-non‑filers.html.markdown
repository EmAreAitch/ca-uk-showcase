## 📘 What Do Sections 206AB & 206CCA Provide?

* **Section 206AB** (TDS): Requires deductors to withhold tax at *twice* the standard rate (or 5%, whichever is higher) on payments to any payee who has not filed ITRs for the preceding two years and whose TDS/TCS aggregate exceeds ₹50,000 in each of those years.
* **Section 206CCA** (TCS): Mirrors 206AB, mandating *double* collection of TCS on specified supplies (e.g., foreign remittances, e‑commerce) from non‑filer sellers.

These rules came into effect on **July 1, 2021**, but compliance headaches persist for many businesses in Delhi’s fast‑moving markets.

## ✅ Who Is Impacted?

1. **Deductors** (payers):  

   * Employers, consultants, professional firms, rent payers, banks—anyone responsible for deducting TDS.  
   * Must check the payee’s ITR status before remitting TDS.
2. **Payees** (recipients):  

   * Individuals, HUFs, partnerships, firms (excluding LLPs)—if they haven’t filed ITRs for the last two assessment years and have high enough TDS/TCS from a single deductor.

| 206C (E‑comm)   | 1% / 5%       | 2% / 10%                     |

> *Note*: Use the *higher* of twice the rate or 5% wherever the slab rate is lower.

## 📊 Delhi‑Centric Example

**Scenario**:  

* **Mr. Verma**, a freelance graphic designer in Hauz Khas Village, did not file ITRs for AY 2023–24 and AY 2024–25.  
* During FY 2024–25, he received ₹1 lakh in fees (Section 194J) from a Connaught Place ad‑agency.  

**Without 206AB**: TDS @ 10% → ₹10,000 withheld.\
**With 206AB**: TDS @ 20% → ₹20,000 withheld (double the standard rate).  

Mr. Verma must now file his pending returns, else he risks a permanent higher withholding on all future payments.

## 🧠 Pros & Cons

### ✅ Pros for the Government

* Encourages timely ITR filings  
* Curbs tax evasion  

### ❌ Cons for Taxpayers

* **Cashflow squeeze**: Higher TDS reduces immediate liquidity—painful for small Delhi suppliers in markets like Sarojini Nagar.  
* **Increased compliance**: Deductors need ITR-filing status checks via the TRACES portal before every payment.

## 🔄 Compliance Checklist for Delhi Businesses

1. **Download non‑filer lists** from TRACES monthly.  
2. **Verify payee PAN** & ITR status before TDS deduction.  
3. **Update accounting software** to pick up 206AB/206CCA rates.  
4. **Communicate with vendors**—ask them to file ITRs and submit proof.  
5. **Reconcile TDS certificates** (Form 16A) carefully to avoid disputes.

## 📝 Practical Delhi Tips

1. **Leverage CA networks** in CP and Karol Bagh to bulk‑update vendor lists.  
2. **Host an ITR‑filing drive** for your contractors—partner with a local CA firm in Nehru Place to expedite filings.  
3. **Schedule TRACES downloads** during off‑peak hours to avoid portal congestion.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Sections 206AB and 206CCA have made timely ITR filing *non‑negotiable* for professionals and businesses in New Delhi. As your Delhi‑based CA, I recommend setting up quarterly vendor reviews, automating non‑filer checks, and educating your payees on the cashflow benefits of staying compliant. Should you need help updating your TDS procedures or running a bulk‐ITR filing camp in Patel Nagar, feel free to reach out!
