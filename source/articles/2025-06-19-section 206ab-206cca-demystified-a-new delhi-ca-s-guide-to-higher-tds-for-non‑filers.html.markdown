## 📘 What Do HMRC’s Higher Withholding Rules Mean?

While the UK tax system does not have a direct equivalent to India’s Sections 206AB/206CCA, it does apply **higher tax deductions** when subcontractors or contractors fail to stay compliant:

* **CIS (Construction Industry Scheme)** — If a subcontractor is not registered with HMRC for CIS, contractors must deduct tax at **30%** instead of the standard 20%.
* **IR35 (Off-Payroll Working)** — If IR35 applies and the contractor is caught by the rules, the client must deduct income tax and NICs as if they were an employee.
* **PAYE & RTI Non-Compliance** — Errors in payroll or misclassifying workers can result in backdated tax liabilities and penalties.

## ✅ Who Is Affected?

**Deductors:**  
- Building contractors and developers under CIS.  
- Companies engaging freelancers and contractors where IR35 might apply.  
- Employers running PAYE payrolls.

**Payees:**  
- Subcontractors not CIS-registered.  
- Contractors using PSCs failing IR35 status tests.
- Workers incorrectly working as self-employed.

## 📊 Example for UK Contractors

**Example:**  

* Liam, a self-employed plumber in Manchester, didn’t renew his CIS registration this tax year.
* His main contractor must now deduct 30% tax instead of 20% on payments.
* Liam’s cashflow drops, and he’ll need to reclaim any overpaid tax through Self Assessment.
