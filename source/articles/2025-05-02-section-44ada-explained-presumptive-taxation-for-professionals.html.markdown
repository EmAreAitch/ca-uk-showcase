# Understanding Simplified Expenses & Cash Basis for UK Professionals

As Chartered Accountants, we often advise UK professionals — consultants, designers, sole traders and small partnerships — on how to keep tax compliance simple and cost-effective. HMRC’s **Simplified Expenses** and **Cash Basis** rules are practical tools for this. This article breaks them down in clear terms.

## 📘 What are Simplified Expenses & Cash Basis?

**Simplified Expenses** let eligible sole traders and partnerships use flat rates instead of calculating actual business costs for things like working from home, vehicle costs, and living at business premises.

The **Cash Basis** allows small businesses to record income and expenses only when the money actually comes in or goes out, rather than using traditional accrual accounting.

Both schemes are designed to cut admin and make tax returns more straightforward.

## ✅ Who Can Use These Schemes?

**You can use Simplified Expenses and Cash Basis if:**

1. You’re a **sole trader** or a **partnership** (not LLPs or limited companies).
2. Your annual business turnover is below **£150,000** when starting (Cash Basis limit).
3. You’re not in an excluded profession (for example, farming or property business might have special rules).

## 💼 Key Conditions & Limits

**Cash Basis:**
- You must have a turnover below £150,000 to start.
- You stay in the scheme until your turnover hits £300,000.
- You only declare income when you’re paid, and claim expenses when you pay them.

**Simplified Expenses:**
- Use flat rates for:
  * **Business mileage** (45p per mile for cars and vans up to 10,000 miles, 25p after)
  * **Working from home** (£10–£26 per month, depending on hours worked)
  * **Living at your business premises** (specific flat rates depending on occupants)

## 📊 Example

Let’s say a freelance consultant earns £60,000 in 2024–25:

- They choose Cash Basis, so they only pay tax on what clients have actually paid them that year.
- They use Simplified Expenses to claim business mileage at the flat rate instead of tracking every fuel and service cost.
- This means simpler bookkeeping and fewer calculations for allowable expenses.

## 🧠 Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros:

- Easy record keeping.
- No need for complex accounting software.
- Clear flat rates for common costs.
- Better cash flow management for small businesses.

### ❌ Cons:

- Not always tax-efficient for businesses with high costs (flat rates might give smaller deductions than actual costs).
- Limited to sole traders and traditional partnerships.
- May limit loss relief options compared to accrual accounting.

## 🔄 Switching Back

If you switch from Cash Basis to traditional accounting (or vice versa), you’ll need to make sure income and expenses aren’t counted twice — or missed altogether. HMRC provides guidance for adjusting your accounts.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

HMRC’s **Simplified Expenses** and **Cash Basis** are great options for small professional practices wanting less admin. But they’re not the best fit for everyone — especially if you have high running costs or want to offset bigger capital allowances.

📌 **Pro Tip:** Always review whether these schemes suit your business year by year. Speak to your accountant to get tailored advice before filing your return.
