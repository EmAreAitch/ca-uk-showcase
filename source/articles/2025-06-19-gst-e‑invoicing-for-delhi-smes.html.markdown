# Making Tax Digital for UK SMEs: A Chartered Accountant’s Practical Handbook

As a practising Chartered Accountant in London — where small retailers in Camden or service firms in Manchester juggle busy invoices — the rollout of **Making Tax Digital (MTD) for VAT** has fundamentally reshaped VAT reporting and digital record‑keeping. Since April 1, 2022, virtually every VAT‑registered business with taxable turnover above £85,000 must keep digital records and submit VAT returns through MTD‑compatible software. This guide demystifies the process, highlights UK‑specific considerations, and shares practical tips I’ve gathered advising SMEs nationwide.

## 📘 What Is Making Tax Digital for VAT?

**MTD for VAT** requires businesses to:
- Keep **digital records** of sales and purchases.
- Use **compatible software** to submit VAT returns.
- Maintain a clear **digital link** between records and final return (no manual copy‑paste).

The aim is to reduce errors, improve compliance and move towards a fully digital tax system.

## ✅ Who Must Comply?

Since April 2022:
* All VAT‑registered businesses **above the £85,000 turnover threshold**.
* Voluntary registration: Smaller businesses below the threshold can also join MTD voluntarily.

Typical examples include:
- A café chain in Birmingham.
- Freelance consultancies in Leeds charging VAT.
- Online sellers using Shopify or Amazon FBA above the limit.

## 🔧 Step‑by‑Step Setup

1. **Sign Up for MTD VAT**  
   Register for MTD via HMRC’s portal. Make sure you have your VAT number, Government Gateway ID, and up-to-date email.

2. **Choose Compatible Software**  
   Use HMRC‑approved software — like Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, or FreeAgent. Many SMEs start with spreadsheets but must use **bridging software** to stay compliant.

3. **Set Up Digital Records**  
   Maintain sales, purchases, VAT invoices and adjustments digitally. Avoid manual re‑typing — digital links are mandatory.

4. **Submit Returns Digitally**  
   File VAT returns through your chosen software. Direct submission via the HMRC website is **not permitted** under MTD.

5. **Keep Evidence & Backup**  
   Store records securely for at least **6 years** as required by UK VAT rules.

## 📊 Common Pitfalls in the UK

1. **Spreadsheets Alone Don’t Cut It**  
   Using spreadsheets is fine only if combined with bridging software to keep digital links intact.

2. **Missed Deadlines**  
   VAT return deadlines stay the same — usually 1 month + 7 days after the end of the VAT period. Missing them may incur penalties under HMRC’s points-based system.

3. **Incorrect Software Settings**  
   Make sure your VAT rates, exemptions and flat‑rate schemes (if applicable) are configured correctly.

## 📝 Practical UK Tips

1. **Upgrade Early**  
   Don’t wait till your VAT quarter ends. Set up MTD early to avoid last‑minute hiccups.

2. **Train Your Bookkeeper**  
   Many errors happen when the old manual copy‑paste mindset clashes with digital links.

3. **Check Bridging Software Licences**  
   If you use spreadsheets, ensure your bridging tool is approved and up‑to‑date.

4. **Set Reminders**  
   Use software reminders or your accountant’s portal to track deadlines.

5. **Keep a Backup Plan**  
   Store backups securely — HMRC can check up to 6 years of digital VAT records.
