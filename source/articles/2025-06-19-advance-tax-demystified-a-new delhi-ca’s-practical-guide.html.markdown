# Advance Tax in the UK: A Chartered Accountant’s Practical Guide

I’m **Ritu Sharma**, a Chartered Accountant based in London. Every year, clients ask me: “How do I plan for my tax payments so I don’t get a surprise bill from HMRC?” In the UK, self-employed individuals and landlords often pay **Payments on Account** — advance tax instalments to spread their liability across the year. This practical guide explains who must pay, how it works, key deadlines, an example, and tips to stay penalty-free.

## 📘 What Are Payments on Account?

Payments on Account are advance payments towards your next year’s **Self Assessment tax bill**. If your last Self Assessment bill was over £1,000 and less than 80% of your tax is collected at source (through PAYE), HMRC expects you to make these advance payments. 

It covers:

- **Self-employed professionals & sole traders**
- **Landlords receiving rental income**
- **Partners in a partnership**
- Anyone with untaxed income (dividends, side gigs, capital gains not fully covered by PAYE)

## ✅ Who Needs to Pay?

In the UK, you’ll usually pay Payments on Account if:

- Your last tax bill was over £1,000 after PAYE and other credits.
- Less than 80% of your total tax is collected at source.
- You expect similar or higher untaxed income this year.

## 📅 Due Dates & Payment Structure

You make **two equal advance payments** — each is **50% of last year’s tax bill** (excluding Capital Gains and Student Loan repayments).

| Instalment | Due Date       | Amount                  |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 1st        | 31 January     | 50% of previous bill    |
| 2nd        | 31 July        | Remaining 50%           |
| Final balancing payment | Next 31 January | Adjust for any difference |

If your actual tax is higher than last year’s estimate, you pay a **balancing payment** by the next 31 January. If your actual income is lower, you can apply to reduce Payments on Account.

## 💼 How to Calculate

1. **Check your last Self Assessment bill** (excluding Capital Gains & Student Loan repayments).
2. Divide by 2 — that’s each instalment.
3. If you expect your income to drop, you can apply online or via your tax adviser to reduce payments.
4. Pay online through your HMRC account, Direct Debit, or via your accountant’s software.
