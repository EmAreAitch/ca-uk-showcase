# Advance Tax Demystified: A New Delhi CA’s Practical Guide

I’m **CA Ritu Sharma**, practising in New Delhi, and every year clients ask me: “When and how much advance tax do I need to pay?” Under India’s pay‑as‑you‑earn regime, advance tax ensures you don’t run into hefty interest under Sections 234B/234C. This guide breaks down who must pay, how to compute your liability, key due dates, a Delhi‑centric example, and practical tips to stay ahead.

## 📘 What Is Advance Tax?

Advance tax (also called “payable at source”) requires taxpayers whose total tax liability exceeds ₹10,000 in a financial year to estimate and pay tax in installments rather than as a lump sum at year‑end. It covers:

- **Salaried individuals** earning additional income (rent, interest, freelance fees)  
- **Professionals & consultants** (Section 44ADA or normal scheme)  
- **Business taxpayers** (presumptive or regular)  
- **Capital gains** and **other income heads**  

Failure to comply invites interest under **Section 234B** (shortfall after March 31) and **Section 234C** (deferred instalments).

## ✅ Who Must Pay?

Any taxpayer (individual, HUF, firm, company) whose **total tax liability** for FY 2025–26 exceeds ₹10,000 after deducting TDS and other credits. In Delhi, this often includes:

- Freelance architects with side rentals in Karol Bagh  
- Consultants earning consultancy fees above ₹1 lakh  
- Landlords receiving house‑rent receipts over ₹50,000 per month

## 💼 How to Compute Your Liability

1. **Estimate total income** across all heads—salary, business, capital gains, other sources.
2. **Apply deductions** under Sections 80C–80U (e.g., PPF, ELSS, health insurance).
3. **Compute tax** as per slab rates, add cess and surcharge.
4. **Subtract expected TDS/TCS** credits (e.g., Form 16, Form 26AS).
5. **Allocate instalments** according to due‑date percentages above.

## 📊 Delhi‑Centric Illustration

Imagine **Mr. Kapoor**, a freelance interior decorator based in South Delhi:

- **Estimated total income** for FY 2025–26: ₹20 lakhs  
- **Deductions** (80C, 80D): ₹3 lakhs  
- **Taxable income**: ₹17 lakhs  
- **Tax + cess**: approx. ₹2,71,000  
- **TDS credit**: ₹50,000  
- **Advance tax liability**: ₹2,21,000  

| Installment | Due Date     | Amount (₹)     |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1st         | 15 June      | 33,150 (15%)   |
| 2nd         | 15 Sept     | 64,230 (cumulative 45%) |
| 3rd         | 15 Dec      | 55,250 (to reach 75%)   |
| 4th         | 15 Mar      | 68,370 (balance)        |

## 📝 Practical Tips for New Delhi Taxpayers

1. **Re‑forecast after Monsoon**: Delhi’s seasonal rentals and event fees spike post‑rain; adjust your September instalment.  
2. **Leverage Tech**: Use the Income‑Tax e‑filing portal well before due dates to avoid last‑minute glitches.  
3. **Maintain a Contingency Fund**: Keep at least 10% extra in your advance‑tax pool to cover unforeseen consultancy earnings.  
4. **Coordinate with TDS Debtors**: Request Form 16A early from Delhi‑NCR clients so you can factor in credits.  
5. **Use the “Self‑Assessment Tax” slot**: If you miss an instalment, pay the shortfall under Self‑Assessment before filing your return to minimize 234C interest.
