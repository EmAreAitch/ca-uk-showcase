# Understanding Private Residence Relief: How to Reduce UK Capital Gains Tax

As a **Chartered Accountant in London**, I often help clients manage their Capital Gains Tax (CGT) liabilities when selling property. One of the most valuable tools is **Private Residence Relief (PRR)** — which can **exempt part or all of the gain** if certain conditions are met.

Below is a practical overview, with examples and tips tailored for UK homeowners and landlords.

---

## 📘 What is Private Residence Relief?

**Private Residence Relief** (PRR) allows you to **sell your main home without paying Capital Gains Tax**, provided it’s been your only or main residence throughout ownership.

> 🏠 If you’ve lived in the property as your main home for the whole period, the **full gain is exempt**.  
> 🗂️ If you’ve let it out or used it partly for business, only part of the gain may qualify.

---

## ✅ Who Can Claim PRR?

You can claim PRR if:  
- You are an **individual** (companies can’t claim PRR).  
- The property has been your **only or main residence**.  
- You haven’t rented out the whole property (some letting relief may apply if you have).  
- You haven’t used part of it exclusively for business.

---

## 💼 What Period is Exempt?

Generally:  
- The period you **lived in the home as your main residence**.  
- The final **9 months of ownership** always qualify, even if you didn’t live there then. (It’s **36 months** for disabled owners or those moving into care.)

## 📊 Example

**Example:**  

* Sarah sells her London flat in June 2025 for £600,000.  
* She bought it for £300,000 ten years ago.  
* She lived there for 8 years, then rented it out for 2 years.  

Her gain is £300,000.  
- Private Residence Relief covers 8/10 years: £240,000 exempt.  
- Final 9 months: also exempt.  
- Remaining £60,000 taxed at CGT rates (18% or 28% for residential property, depending on income).

She may also get **Letting Relief** (up to £40,000) if she lived there with tenants — but this is more limited under current rules.

## 🔄 Capital Gains Allowance

Don’t forget:  
- The **Annual Exempt Amount** (£3,000 in 2025/26, subject to future changes) applies to total gains across all disposals.  
- Married couples can each use their allowance.

---

## 🧠 Key Pros & Cons

**✅ Pros:**  
- Can fully eliminate CGT if conditions are met.  
- Final 9-month rule helps when moving before a sale.  
- Letting Relief may help partial landlords.

**❌ Cons:**  
- Second homes don’t qualify (but you can nominate a main residence if you own more than one).  
- Using parts exclusively for business may reduce relief.  
- CGT still applies to any gain that doesn’t qualify.

## 📝 Practical UK Taxpayer Tips

1. **Keep evidence** of when you lived in the property (council tax, utility bills).  
2. **Consider a nomination** if you own two homes — HMRC lets you pick which is your main one (within 2 years of changing).  
3. **Time your sale** — living in the home before sale extends PRR coverage.  
4. **Plan for letting** — check if partial letting relief applies.  
5. **Consult your accountant** for exact gain calculations and HMRC reporting (usually due within 60 days of completion).

## 🚀 Final Word

Private Residence Relief is one of the UK’s most valuable CGT breaks for homeowners. But the rules can get tricky with letting, multiple homes, or mixed use. Careful planning can save thousands.
